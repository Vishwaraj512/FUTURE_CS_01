# üõ°Ô∏è FUTURE INTERNS Cyber Security - Task 1: Web Application Security Assessment

## Project Overview
This project, **FUTURE_CS_01**, documents the process and findings of a **Web Application Vulnerability Assessment** conducted on a sample web application (Damn Vulnerable Web Application - DVWA). The goal was to identify critical vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws using industry-standard penetration testing tools.

This assessment demonstrates practical skills in web application security testing, threat modeling, and formulating effective mitigation strategies.

## üéØ Task Objectives
As per the internship guidelines, the objectives were to:
1.  Set up a secure, isolated testing environment (DVWA).
2.  Conduct hands-on testing for major OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
3.  Generate a detailed security report with analysis and remediation steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
The following industry-standard tools were utilized for vulnerability scanning and manual exploitation:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OWASP ZAP** | Automated and manual security testing (vulnerability scanning, fuzzing, forced browsing). |
| **Burp Suite** | Intercepting, analyzing, and modifying HTTP requests/responses. Used for session analysis and manual attack construction. |
| **SQLMap** | Automated detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. |

## üîç Key Findings & Deliverables
The full findings and detailed mitigation strategies are provided in the **[Security Report: Task 1](Report_Task_1.pdf)** file in this repository.

| Vulnerability Found | Severity | Summary of Attack | Mitigation Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SQL Injection (SQLi)** | High | Successfully bypassed the login mechanism and extracted database information using union-based and time-based injection techniques. | Recommended the implementation of **Prepared Statements** (Parameterized Queries). |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Medium | Exploited both stored and reflected XSS flaws by injecting JavaScript payloads that executed in the victim's browser. | Recommended strict **Output Encoding** and implementation of a robust **Content Security Policy (CSP)**. |
| **Broken Authentication** | Medium | Used Burp Suite's Intruder tool to successfully brute-force weak user credentials due to a lack of rate-limiting controls. | Recommended **Rate Limiting** on login attempts and enforcement of **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**. |


## üìÇ Repository Structure


## üìà Skills Developed
* **Web Application Penetration Testing:** Gained hands-on experience following structured testing methodologies (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
* **Vulnerability Remediation:** Formulated practical, technical recommendations based on industry best practices.
* **Professional Reporting:** Developed skills in documenting technical findings clearly for both technical and managerial audiences.
